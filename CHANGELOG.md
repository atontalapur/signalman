## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- `internal/event`, the first Go package: `Value`, a closed sum type over
  null, string, int, bool, and list; `Event`, the unit of work, whose
  `Field` reads an absent name as null so Sigma `field: null` matches both
  absence and an explicit null; and `Verdict`, the per (event, rule) record
  the v1 to v2 cutover compares.
- Go module `github.com/atontalapur/signalman` on Go 1.27. The `go` CI job
  now runs `make check` on every PR.

### Changed

- Toolchain moved from Go 1.23 to Go 1.27; staticcheck and govulncheck pins
  updated to versions that build on it.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- `make check` runs the same gofmt, vet, tidy, build, race test, staticcheck,
  and govulncheck pass locally and in CI, so a green PR means a green machine.
- Nightly fuzzing with a ten minute budget per target; crashers are kept as
  workflow artifacts.
- Tag-driven releases: a `v*` tag builds every `cmd/*` binary for linux and
  darwin, publishes archives with checksums, and pushes the daemon image to
  GHCR. The tag must match `VERSION`.
- Dependabot for Go modules and GitHub Actions.
- PR policy: Conventional Commit titles and a `SIG-<n>` Jira reference are
  required to merge.
- `scripts/backlog_check.py` validates `docs/backlog.yml` before it is synced
  to Jira.
- Project `CLAUDE.md` with the spec invariants and a table of which gstack
  and superpowers skills to use at each point in the workflow; `.claude/`
  settings with a gofmt-on-write hook.
